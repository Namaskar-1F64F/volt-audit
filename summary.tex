% FIXME
I spent a total of 20 hours reviewing the changes split across four days. I have reviewed Volt protocol in the past so I already had a good understanding of the system. 

In this review, I did an in depth review of VoltSystemOracle.sol & VoltSystemOracle.t.sol. I also did an in depth review on the deployment scripts and integration tests. 
% FIXME
The review was over \href{https://github.com/volt-protocol/volt-protocol-core/pull/82}{PR #82}. Specifically, commit \href{https://github.com/volt-protocol/volt-protocol-core/pull/82/commits/73a7ead63b61afc8c65f39efae2180d7d94cf080}{73a7ead}. 

I found one issue with the implementation that was fully fixed. There are a few limitations to be aware of all outlined in \href{https://github.com/volt-protocol/volt-protocol-core/blob/feat/volt-oracle/governance-docs/VIP-2.md#known-contract-limitations}{VIP2.md}.
