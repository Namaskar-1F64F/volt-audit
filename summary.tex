% FIXME
I spent a total of 10 hours reviewing the changes split across two days. I have reviewed Volt protocol in the past so I already had a good understanding of the system. 

In this review, I spent a majority of my time reviewing VoltSystemOracle.sol & VoltSystemOracle.t.sol. I also did a less comprehensive review on the deployment scripts and integration tests. 
% FIXME
The review was over \href{https://github.com/volt-protocol/volt-protocol-core/pull/82}{PR #82}. Specifically, commit \href{https://github.com/volt-protocol/volt-protocol-core/pull/82/commits/73a7ead63b61afc8c65f39efae2180d7d94cf080}{73a7ead}. 

I found no issues with the implementation. There are a few limitations to be aware of all outlined in \href{https://github.com/volt-protocol/volt-protocol-core/blob/feat/volt-oracle/governance-docs/VIP-2.md#known-contract-limitations}{VIP2.md}.
