% FIXME
I performed a security review of the Volt System Oracle over two days for a total of 10 hours. During this time, I became familiar with the protocol,
did a line by line review, and thought of potential attack vectors if I were a malicious attacker. An area of particular concern was the deployment script for VIP 2.
% FIXME
The review was over \href{https://github.com/volt-protocol/volt-protocol-core/pull/82}{PR #82} in its entirety. Specifically, commit \href{https://github.com/volt-protocol/volt-protocol-core/pull/82/commits/73a7ead63b61afc8c65f39efae2180d7d94cf080}{73a7ead}. 

I found no issues with the implementation.
